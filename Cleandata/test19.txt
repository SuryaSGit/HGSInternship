Desktop Users will not be offered this option. •We handle Facebook conversations similar to Pistonheads.   •Instead of the lead ID being sent via the shopper, the ID is sent on the back end and auto-loaded into the lead form.  If you need to plug in the lead ID, you can find it in the “Customer Info” section under Type.    •Customers will simply start the conversation by asking their question.  No need to collect first/last name, we already have it!   •We do not do MDs on these. Simply use #DifferentDealerListing This feature is available on select Canada VDPs for now.

Probe if necessary or Research & Answer 3. Gather Contact Info Either the phone number or phone number and email if it wasn’t provided already. 4. Ask a fully helped question. 5. Brand/Close 6. Send a link to the VDP: •Facebook Closing Listed on pre-defined content •To visit the vehicle you were previously on, please see the link below: INSERT VDP LINK     Why do we do this?  When the customer selects to message through Facebook, they are chatting with us through the messenger app. At that point, the customer is no longer on the site and has no way to get back to the VDP. BY us sending the VDP at the end of the conversation we are providing the customer with the link and adding to the customer service experience.     Pro Tips- •You would not see a lot of multiple-vehicle conversations, because most web visitors are only able to chat in on one VDP at a time. •There is no character count. •Returning customers do not happen much on webs. Visitors could be using a public IP address. If it is a returning customer, we verify it’s the same person before assuming. •When asking for help from the LOs, please provide the conversation ID. •We can ask the visitors for a bit of time to look up info:                     Bear With Me                     “Would you please bear with me while I look into this?” •What To Do When VDPs Do Not Load •If you can’t load the VDP, use the new predefined content for Ref ID won’t load. Then close the chat. •We do not transfer web chats!
