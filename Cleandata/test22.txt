Web Handling Click "Read More" to View Article Handling Webs Steps                                         As soon as a customer clicks the "chat" button, an automated message is sent asking for the visitor’s name. Once they respond, they are then connected to LivePerson. Visitor may give a name or go right into a question.  If they give their name, we greet with the Greeting - Email Probe​  If you do not get a name, GREET and then PROBE or RESEARCH/ANSWER. Example: Hi! This is AGENT from CarGurus. How can I help you with this VEHICLE? Example: Hi! This is AGENT from CarGurus. Would you please bear with me while I look into this?” When it’s time to ask for contact info, we have two options; Option One: If we have an email, we use ... Contact Info Chat Have Email​ Option Two: If we do not have an email, we use... Contact Info Chat - If No Info   White CheckMarks -  Here’s how to handle chats when you can see the customer has left the chat because of the single white checkmark •If we have contact info and have a connecting statement in our answer, we have consent to submit that chat if the customer drops off.   •There is no need to continue a conversation when the customer drops off and we don’t have a name or any contact info. We will close these out as soon as we see the white checkmark and use closing with phone number.   •We will “finish” these chats politely and according to policy, since the customer may re-open the chat.   •If we have consent, we will send a polite common closing and submit the lead.   •If we don’t have consent, we will send closing with phone number.   •If we don’t have a name or contact info, we will send closing with phone number.   •Don’t drag out conversations with probing questions if the customer has left the chat!   Please make sure if the customer asks a question even if its a white checkmark we still answer the question. This helps in case the customer comes back to the chat, they will be able to see the answer.            Important Things to Keep In Mind You would not see a lot of multiple vehicle conversations, because most web visitors are only able to chat in on one VDP at a time. There is no character count. Returning customers do not happen much on webs. Visitors could be using a public IP address. If it is a returning customer, we verify it’s the same person before assuming. When asking for help from the LOs, please provide the conversation ID. We can ask the visitors for a bit of time to look up information by sending the Bear With Me predefined content. Remember to always thank the customer for waiting when you come back with their information! We do not transfer web chats!    Reference ID won't load- When the reference Id won't load and the page navigation does not have a link we will send- I apologize, but I am experiencing a rare technical issue where I can’t see the listing you chatted about. Please use the other methods of contact on the listing and we will be happy to answer your questions. Thanks for choosing CarGurus!                                          We won't mention technical issues in any other conversation. If the link is showing in the Navigation widget, pull up the VDP and help the customer. Remember, we cannot say the dealer is going to reach out. You must ask the customer to call the dealer at the tracked number to confirm any information. Remember to remove your connecting statement.          Ex: "This Honda is still showing as available. To confirm no deals are pending, please call DEALERNAME at NUMBER." We will no longer ask for the URL, dealer name, year, make and model  Web Chat Timing Greet the customer within 20 seconds. We have 90 seconds to respond to the customer. Send first response/question and wait 3 minutes. Send next response/question and wait 3 minutes. Brand/Closing and wait a few seconds to close
