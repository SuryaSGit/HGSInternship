Vehicle History Click "Read More" To View Article Vehicle History   "Is there a CarFax/AutoCheck?" "Can you tell me about any accidents?" "Service history?" "Condition?" "What's wrong with it?" "Does it have any rust?" "What's the warranty?"   Required words: None   Let the customer know why you’re sending the CarFAX “Here’s a link to the CarFAX that has some service and maintenance records: “Here is a link to the AutoCheck, which is similar to a CarFAX, that gives details about the title Follow up with a good reason why we need to have the dealer get in touch – that’s also a reason to ask for contact info! “I will have a specialist at the dealership contact you to go over that report." “I will have the dealership reach out to confirm those details." “I will have the dealership get in touch to go over the history of this Porsche. "     Additional Things to Keep in Mind: If you don’t find a history report or any info on the dealer description, use #vehicle details no Tag these as nocarhistory Only use #nocarhistory if the customer asks for a history report and we can’t find one When we provide any information from the CarFAX or AutoCheck, we should send that report if it’s available. We do not need to send CarFAX or AutoCheck if there are no title issues or no accidents reported. That we can take from the VDP vehicle history section. Be sure to quote exactly what the VDP says. Don’t say it’s a clean title. Instead, say, “My information says there are no title issues reported.” If there is other information, be sure you quote it exactly “My information says there is salvage history reported.” Then send a history report if one is available. If a customer asks about accident details, we should send the CarFAX or AutoCheck. Do not quote any accident details! Do: Here is a link to the CarFAX that may have details on the reported accident: Don’t: My information says this was in a rear-end collision, and airbags deployed. If a person asks for a CarFAX and we send an AutoCheck, we need to explain what it is  "here's a link to the AutoCheck report, which is similar to a CarFAX   Tagging  If you send a CarFAX, tag it CarFAX If you send an AutoCheck, tag it AutoCheck If they ask for either and we can’t find one, tag it nocarhistory If a customer asks a phrase which would trigger a history report, but one does not exist, we answer VehicleDetailsNo, and tag nocarhistory   What Can You Quote?   You can quote anything from the top information section.   Examples: The trim package  2009 HYUNDAI SONATA SE/LIMITED;   the VIN, 5NPEU46C69H436757; the engine, 2.4L I4 F DOHC 16V GASOLINE; number of owners, and what type of ownership, like personal vehicle, rental, fleet or personal lease.   What You Can't Quote: Send the CarFAX for these questions, but don't quote from it Service records                           Maintenance history                                            Where was it owned?                  Warranty questions!   In the instances where the customer says the vdp doesnt match the carfax-  Ex: The vehicle history says there is no accidents but the carfax shows two, why is that? We want to say " My information shows the information on CarGurus is pulled from the Autocheck report, the carfax is an extended history report that may have more info.
