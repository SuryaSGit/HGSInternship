Dealer information questions must be processed, even if the customer asks the question in the greeting. Send your branded greeting first, then answer the dealer information question Important!- We cannot have the dealer reach out to confirm their address, so if the customer asks for dealer information with no other topic, we must probe to see if we can assist with anything else. If we do not get another topic we cannot connnect the customer with the dealer The exeptions would be if the address is the city  and state and not the pysical address. We would then say-  I will connect you with the dealer on site to provide specific address information Reminder for online dealers we would provide the link and say My info shows this is an online dealer with no pysical location, I will connect you with the dealer on site to proivde detailed infor on their process.

We can only send the link to the dealer’s home page and encourage the customer to explore for more information Ex, “Here’s a link to the dealer’s website, which may have information about a financing application”   !!Important!!
