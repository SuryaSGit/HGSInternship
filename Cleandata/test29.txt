FLOOR ETIQUETTE   Please, make sure you are communicating with the Team Leaders if you have some concerns about anything going on on the floor. That being said,   The group chat is to be used strictly for work purposes. Generally, the chat platform is for work. If you choose to send private messages to one another, be mindful of the fact that HR can pull and review those messages at any time. Our strongest advice, keep professional. All conversations regarding religion, gender, sex, and politics are strictly forbidden. We all have different backgrounds, beliefs, and opinions. What you consider normal might be considered hostile for another. Keep your language professional in the chatroom and on the floor.     As the team grows, the pool of views and opinions grows with it. Any matters related to sex, religion, and politics are prone to cause a “hostile work environment” for others. Per HGS policies this is strictly forbidden. Failure to follow will result in corrective action up to termination.
