Digital Retail Greeting  As of right now we just need to use a standard greeting : Hi this AGENT from CarGurus! In the information tab if they are past the contact info submission a name will be available. If you would like to make the chat more personable we can greet them by name. Ex: Hi Stan! This is Agent from CarGurus!  Refer to Where is the customer at tab for photos We do not need to confirm a name nor an email since we are not going to be submitting any leads, the exception for this would be if this would be a tier 2 tranfer. Tier 2 transfer. We would like their email. Please put the email and a summary in the summary box along with a link if it is available to assist the Tier 2 team before we transfer.  If the customer does not provide an email whether it is in the chat or from the info tab please not in the summary notes before transferring.   Refer to Tier 2 Transfer guide for step by step instructions   We are here to assist the customer in the process of going through this form. A lot of their questions we are not going to be able to answer, but we can still assist. Once the customer is past the submit info on the first page the dealer already has their info and will be reaching out. This makes our job a lot easier.  Ex: Pricing- The dealer will be reaching out as soon as they are available to discuss the price on this X, as a CarGurus agent I am unable to negotiate the price.  check to see where they are and prompt them on  If you continue to the next page it will allow you to select if you have a trade in, if you do not have one you can select skip etc Then probe. We do want to provide the dealerships name and number in every conversation- EX:  If you would like to reach DEALERNAME before they are able to reach out, their number to call is X  This can be provided before the last probe or before the closing. If the customer is not past the first tab we will want to edit this, as the dealer will not receive their info until after page 1  see photo below. If not past the first tab. If you would like to reach DEALERNAME direclty, you can reach them by calling X. *Refer to where is the customer at TAB for a walk through photo guide*   What the Customer Sees First Page- Contact Info - Customer will enter their contact information and then sign in or create an account  Once the customer has filled out this section and moves to the next page, this automatically sends their information to the dealership. 2nd Page - Pick up or Delivery   - Customer will choose how they'd like to receive their car. Page 3 - Trade In - If the customer has a trade in they will put their info in, if the customer doesn't have one, they will select the button at the bottom that says Skip Trade In. This will take them to the next page  Step 4 -Choose how you will pay - The customer will have the choice of selecting financing or paying cash. If the customer has outside financing we will advise them to select the cash option and they can let the dealer know when they reach out. This will allow them to move to the next page.  *The financing tab is a pre-approval estimate  this means their credit has not been ran and can change the down payment amount wont always be able to be changed until the credit is ran. We would want to use our financing red words and instruct the customer to select the cash option to move to protection plans. The dealer will be able to discuss if their down payment  zero-lowest can be done.               Step 5- Protection Plans - Customer will have the option to select a protection plan, but one is not needed to move forward. If the customer selects the blue continue button without selecting a protection plan that will allow them to move on Step 6  & 7 - Place Deposit and Schedule - The customer will place a $500 fully refundable deposit  If they want to skip, they have the option to select the Skip button  Review & Submit- There is a optional comment box at the bottom, if the customer needs to put anything in  Ex: Need a different date, would like to discuss X. If the customers date is not available, they can select a different one and leave a comment  Example explained Q-Regarding the 2nd photo with ABC Mazda of Boston This is if the customer is using the dealers financing partners, not CarGurus. This is just an estimate of what the customer can expect to pay using the APR that the dealer provided us. The consumer can change this to $0 but that doesnâ€™t mean they will have a $0 down payment. We should quote the disclaimer about estimates at the bottom of the screen.  Last Step- Confirmation  There will be a green check mark that says All Set. We've sent a copy of your deal to you and DEALERNAME. Whats Next:   1. Dealer will reach out to confrm your appointment within 24 hours  will have the date and time listed 2. Head to your appointment   Make sure to bring -your summary email, drivers license, Insurance If you already have it, proof of income or residence. DEALERNAME may ask you to fill out some forms but  you won't have to complete another credit app. 3. Test Drive & Finalize- Take the car for a spin to make sure its the right one. Then dsicuss any add-ones and determine your trade-in value to finalize your deal. Not the car for you? No worries, your deal is not a binding commitment and you're not obligated to purchase at this time. At the end  they will be provided the Dealerships name, address and phone number. The customer will have a sounds good button to click
