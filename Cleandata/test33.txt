Required words:  Since I’m a CarGurus agent, I'm unable to quote the price - OR -  since I’m a CarGurus agent, I'm unable to negotiate the price. Predefined Content: I will have a specialist on site contact you about XX. Since I'm a CarGurus agent, I'm unable to quote or negotiate the price.   Make sure you're being specific with your customization to reflect the customer's question!                 Side Note: Pricing History  There is a spot on our VDP that provides pricing history. We are able to quote that information to the customer if they ask by customizing the "Pricing" predefined content Example: “I’d be happy to have a specialist on site follow up to let you know why the price has decreased. Since I’m a CarGurus agent, I'm unable to discuss the price.”     Quote vs. Negotiate? We must customize our predefined content to say "...I cannot quote the price" or "...I cannot negotiate the price", but very rarely will we ever use both! Here are some examples of when to use each:  Quote:  How much is this? Only if the price is not listed OR if the car is in "new" condition What is the out the door price? Negotiate:  I'd like to offer $xxxx What's the lowest you'll take? The price seems too high Some questions are more ambiguous and may use either "quote" or "negotiate".  These situations are highly contextual and you should ask an LO for assistance if you're unsure. Examples are: What's the final price? What's the last price?      Pricing Listed "What's the price?" "How much?" "What's the cash price?"   Required words: Based off my information, this VEHICLE is listed for $X,XXX.   Is the Vehicle New or Used? New: We cannot use Pricing Listed. Instead, use the "Pricing" predefined content above Used: We should use the Pricing Listed predefined content if a price is listed. If the customer is asking about the cash price, customize the predefined content to specify it is listed for $xxxx cash If a price is not listed, use the "Pricing" predefined content above                                                  Pricing Stipulations -  DEALER NOTES - If a customer specifies that they have a ultimatem we need to make sure to include that in the dealer notes.  We will want to make sure to word it appropriately  as some customers may sound hostile. We work for the dealers so we want to make sure it comes accross professional. Ex:  Customer -If the dealer will accept my offer of 25k, I will purchase on Friday. Dealer Notes- Customer would like to purchase on Friday date if their offer of 25k is accepted. Ex: Customer -I only want to be contacted if the dealer will accept my offer, do not contact me unless it is accepted. Dealer Notes - Customer would like to be contacted if there offer of 30k is accepted, not interested otherwise.
