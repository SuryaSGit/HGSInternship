Connecting Statements Click "Read Article" to View Connecting Statements What are Connecting Statements and How to Combine Multiple Topics   What is a "Connecting Statement"? A "Connecting Statement" is the phrase we use to indicate to the customer that we are getting them in touch with the dealer. Some examples include:  Get you in touch Follow up with you Reach out to you   A connecting statement should only be used ONCE per conversation, even if multiple topics are discussed.    How do I Combine Topics Without Using Multiple Connecting Statements? Most of our predefined content contains connecting statements. If multiple topics are discussed, we need to remove the connecting statement from each added topic and simply replace it with an affirmation that the dealer will be discussing the topic with them.    Ex. Availability and Test Drive: "This VEHICLE is still showing as available, but I will have a dealer specialist follow up with you to ensure no deals are pending." and "I will get you in touch with a specialist on-site to set up an appointment to see this VEHICLE." To combine, we should say, "This VEHICLE is still showing as available, but I will have a dealer specialist follow up with you to ensure no deals are pending. I will let them know you'd also like to set up an appointment to see it"   Things to Keep in Mind:  We can say "also" OR "as well" in a sentence, but we should never use both ie, "I'll also let them know you'd like to make an appointment to see it" OR "I'll let them know you'd like to make an appointment to see it as well" A probe is not a connecting statement! We CAN say things like,  Can I assist with anything else before they follow up with you?   Order of Importance  When we have multiple topics in a conversation we want to start with the most important. The dealer Address will also be the first thing we want to address in the conversation. This provides the customer with the information right away on whether this will work for them. Remember if we have not connected them yet we must put the dealership's name. My info shows DEALERNAME is located at X, then continue on.   When a customer wants to discuss financing and a test drive, we will start with financing as it is a bigger topic. This helps ensure that we are getting our red words in. Ex: Several factors influence the monthly payments on this Ford, I will connect you with the finance specialist on-site to provide more info and set up a test drive.  I will connect you with the dealer on-site to discuss your offer and possible shipping options to GA. Since I am a CarGurus agent I am unable to negotiate the price. I will connect you with the dealer on-site to discuss the price of this Ford and set up a possible test drive for Saturday. My info shows this dealer's Saturday hours are X Stipulation - I want to test drive IF they accept my offer of 25k. We will want to start with pricing and change up the test drive part. I will also let the dealer know you would like to test drive if accepted.  If they give a specific date we would still want to follow up with the hour for this day. Whether or not the dealer wants to accept and set up that day we are giving the customer the most information and that keeps them coming back.  I will connect you with the dealer on-site to discuss your offer of X, I will also let them know that you would like to arrange a test drive for Sunday if accepted. My info shows this dealer's hours are X.
