Every employee is responsible for exercising sound judgment and common sense for his or her attire at all times. In extreme circumstances an employee may be asked to return home to change inappropriate attire. All missed time will be unpaid and continuous breach of this policy will initiate the corrective action process.   Suggestion: If you question whether what you intend to wear is acceptable, chances are you should not wear it.
