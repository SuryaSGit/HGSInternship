Company History In 1963, Ruppman Marketing Technologies was founded as a yellow pages agency. In 1973, the Company developed the industry’s first dealer locator database that allowed consumers to locate their nearest dealer or service center using a toll free telephone number. A pioneer in the consumer service support industry, the Company was the first to provide inbound toll-free consumer service. For decades, Ruppman Marketing continued to shape an ever-growing consumer service outsourcing industry with innovative service offerings and technologies, leading the evolution of the call center to the contact center. In 1998, the Company acquired AFFINA, a database management and marketing research company, to help position AFFINA as a one-stop-shop solution for consumer relationship management. In 2006, AFFINA was acquired by HTMT a multi-national business process outsourcing company. AFFINA changed its name to HGS USA, LLC in 2011.   HGS’ continued growth reflects its commitment to offering its clients the best technology and consumer service available anywhere. Following are highlights from HGS’ history.       Section III   THE BASICS OF WORKING AT HGS   We know starting a new job is exciting and at times can be a bit confusing. To make your first few days a little easier, please keep in mind this important information:   Equal Employment Opportunity HGS’ Equal Employment Opportunity EEO policy states: “HGS is firmly committed to a policy of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity, and will administer its personnel policies and conduct its employment practices in a manner that treats each employee and applicant for employment on the basis of merit, experience and other work-related criteria without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, ancestry, age, or any other protected characteristic.”   This policy is an essential part of HGS’ overall commitment to attract, hire and develop a strong, talented and diverse workforce. Management personnel at every level must share in the responsibility of promoting equal opportunity. Additionally, as an HGS employee, you have the responsibility to live by the spirit of this policy and bring management’s attention to actions that are contrary to this policy. Please review the EEO policy and live it daily.    If you believe that you need reasonable accommodation of job functions for the job for which you were hired, and this accommodation is needed due to a handicap or disability, you must take two steps.   First, provide HGS with medical documentation of your handicap or disability; and second, request a specific accommodation. Once HGS determines that an employee has a handicap or disability, we will take all specific requests for accommodation into consideration. We will also consider efficiency, financial burden and impact on other employees and the operation as a whole in determining what, if any, accommodation will result in optimal performance standards being met. In no case will HGS lower its performance standards, nor rewrite job descriptions as to any essential aspects of the job. If you cannot perform essential job functions even with reasonable accommodation, the resulting inability to fully perform your job will be grounds for discharge. However, HGS will make a reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals with known, recognized disabilities unless doing so would result in undue hardship. If you believe you have been unlawfully discriminated against, please follow the same reporting procedures described under “Steps for Reporting Harassment” in the Harassment Policy.   At-Will Statement    Nothing contained in this Handbook is intended to nor does it create a contract of employment for any specific duration. I understand and agree that my employment can be terminated with or without cause and with or without notice at any time at the option of either me or the company             Breaks and Meals Breaks are paid time for you to spend 10 - 15 minutes away from your job duties to refresh yourself. The number of breaks you receive is based on the amount of time you work that day. When Taking a Break, Remember: • Finish working with a client, caller, or co-worker before you take your break. • Stay on HGS premises during your break. • If you voluntarily skip a break, you lose it. • You can’t save up break time in order to leave early. • Please take your break away from your work area in the break rooms provided.   Meal periods are not the same as breaks. Meal periods last at least 30 minutes and you won’t be paid for that time. • Your supervisor will tell you when you should take your lunch. Your lunchtime will vary. • Your meal period will comply with Federal and/or State government standards. • You may leave HGS premises during meal periods. • Please take your meal period away from your work area in the break rooms provided.   Personal Belongings To keep your valuable belongings safe, it’s best not to bring them to work. Remember that HGS is not responsible for these items if they are lost or stolen. Occasionally, HGS may have to go into your desk area, even without your okay or knowledge, because of health, safety, security or other concerns. So please don’t have anything at your desk area that you’re not allowed to bring onto HGS’ premises or that you wouldn’t want others to see.   How to Dress We do not want to create an exhaustive list of acceptable and unacceptable clothing. Exercise good judgment as you select clothing to wear to work.  It is always important that your appearance be neat and that you are dressed appropriately for your job function.  HGS has established a business casual dress code so all employees may work comfortably in our work environment.  Wear items that are professional, clean, and without holes or tears.   Examples of appropriate clothing range from dress shirts with a suit or sport coat to polos or sweaters with Dockers and loafers.  In addition, jeans, athletic shoes, sandals and flip flops may be worn any day of the week.    Weekends On Fridays and weekends employees may also wear hats, T-shirts and sweatshirts, creating a more relaxed environment for our employees.   Please don’t wear shorts, sweatpants or other workout or beach attire. Additionally, clothes that present safety risks or are offensive, distracting or otherwise inappropriate are not acceptable.   HGS & Client Logo wear To promote teamwork and company spirit, you may wear HGS or CLIENT logo wear shirts, T-shirts and sweatshirts any day of the week.   Attendance Expectations For HGS to operate efficiently and meet the expectations of our customers, we need you to be at work during regularly scheduled hours. Your team needs you to be there!   What happens if I am late to work? Being punctual is important in providing excellent service to our customers. Punctuality is important not only at the start of your shift, but also returning from breaks and lunches. If you are tardy too often, disciplinary action, up to and including termination, will result. How do I properly schedule a day off? A scheduled day off is a day that has been approved by the Company by the end of your previous shift and for which you have PTO available in your PTO bank. For more information, see the section on PTO Benefits. For example, if you need Friday off, you get Company approval on Thursday before the end of your shift and ensure time is available on the vacation calendar.   What happens if I’m absent and didn’t schedule the time off? You may get sick, your car may break down, or you may need a day off to attend to a personal crisis. These would all be examples of unscheduled time off. Because the need arose at the last minute, you were unable to schedule a day off. We don’t want to penalize you in those situations, but we only allow a minimum amount of unscheduled time off. If you take too many unscheduled days, disciplinary action, up to and including termination, will result. If you need unscheduled time off, CALL! The sooner you call in, the more time your team has to accommodate your absence and provide excellent service to our customers. We ask that you speak directly with the Traffic Department CSRs or your Supervisor other positions; don’t leave a message. Talking directly to your designated contact ensures there are no misunderstandings.   Will I be paid when I am absent? For any unscheduled absences, you will be paid if you have time available in your PTO bank. For more information, see the section on PTO Benefits.   What if I need to be gone longer than one day? If you know you will be absent more than one day, try and schedule the additional time off. Unless specifically instructed otherwise by your supervisor, you must call in each day you are absent. If you are absent more than three consecutive working days, you must return with a doctor’s excuse. For absences less than two weeks, unscheduled time may be capped. For more information, see your attendance policy.   Will I lose my job if I am late or absent? We hope that won’t happen. But you could lose your job if you are: • Frequently late or absent. • Absent twice without calling designated Company personnel no later than one hour into your scheduled shift.   Our intent is to be fair, to reward outstanding attendance, and to consistently address attendance problems if they arise. Remember: Being late or absent makes work harder for your co-workers!   Telephone Calls Our toll-free numbers are provided for the benefit of our clients. You may not receive personal phone calls on these lines and should not give those numbers to friends and family. To receive a personal phone call in the case of an emergency situation, direct your family and friends to call your immediate supervisor.   Cellular phones, cameras, or any “personal recording devices” may not be used, turned on or accessible in work areas at any time unless you have a legitimate business need for the device.  Also, “personal recording devices” and cameras are not permitted on the call center floor or restrooms. Access to cellular phones, recording devices, or cameras on the call center floor are in direct violation of our Security and Compliance Policy and present a data security risk to our clients and HGS.  Cellular phones may be used in designated break areas away from the call center floor.     Telephones have been provided in the break rooms for your personal use. Please limit the length of your phone calls, so that all employees may access these phones while on break.   Section IV   PERSONAL AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT   Now that you’re a member of HGS, we want you to stay happy and motivated. We are committed to providing you with an environment that fosters personal and career development. We want you to grow with us. HGS gives you the resources and tools to aid you in your personal and career growth.   Job Posting Not only do we support your continued learning in your current position but we enable you to grow within the company through our internal job-posting program. As positions become available within the organization, we’ll let you know by posting openings on our company computer systems. Watch for them!   To apply for posted openings, typically you should have: • Six months in your current non-exempt position or • 12 months in your current exempt position AND • Not be in a critical period of corrective action, Critical period is the first 30 days after receiving any level of corrective action.   Career Enhancement Tips The suggestions below will help you make the most out of your career with HGS:   1. Take personal responsibility for your development and your career. Ask for feedback from your supervisor and peers. Take charge of your own career growth and make sure you communicate your desire to grow to your supervisor.   2. Career development starts with your current job. Your next promotion opportunity depends upon your current performance. Give everything you’ve got to your current position. Concentrate on making a contribution. Be able to answer the question: How is your area different because you are there?   3. Avoid focusing solely on upward movement. Sometimes the best growth happens in a lateral move to another area. This can allow you to develop a wide variety of skills, enabling you to continue to grow and develop.   4. Find out what you need to do if you are interested in a specific opportunity at HGS. If you don’t know, you probably won’t be ready when the opportunity arises.   Section V     COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS   YOUR PAY Our compensation philosophy is to provide pay rates that are competitive, to reward individual performance and achievement, help develop the fullest work potential of our employees, and is flexible and responsive to changing conditions affecting strategies and financial goals.   The HGS Paycheck Pay Period You will be paid bi-weekly on alternate Fridays.   Social Security FICA and Medicare You are automatically covered by the Federal Insurance Compensation Act FICA and Medicare. The company pays one-half the current tax charged by the federal government for both Social Security and Medicare. You pay the remaining half of the current tax through payroll deduction. Contact Payroll if you need to request a copy of a paystub or to stop payment on a lost paycheck. This will result in a minimal fee. Detailed information about the Social Security and Medicare benefit programs is available from the local Social Security Administration Office of Health and Human Services.   Direct Deposit You may also take advantage of our convenient direct deposit program. At your request, we can deposit your paychecks into the bank of your choice. You don’t have to go to the bank each time and deposit your money; it happens automatically. And because we don’t actually distribute a paycheck to you, your chances of having your money lost or stolen are greatly reduced. Consider signing up for direct deposit today!   Shift Premium Pay We understand that working later in the day or on weekends can be inconvenient. To compensate you for accommodating our business needs, you receive an additional amount over and above your regular pay for each hour worked; this is called a shift premium.   Shift premiums apply only to regular, full-time & part-time hourly employees in departments that have regularly scheduled afternoon, evening or weekend shifts. The shift premium amount is based on the time of day you work.    Overtime At times you may be required to work more that 40 hours during a week. Hourly employees earn pay at 11⁄2 times your regular hourly rate for any hours worked in excess of 40 that week.   Things to Remember about Overtime • Your supervisor must approve overtime hours in advance. • Once you have been scheduled for overtime hours, you are expected to work those hours as you would any hours of your regular shift.   Performance Reviews Everyone wants to know how they’re doing on the job. At HGS, we’ll tell you on a regular basis. All hourly call center and fulfillment employees will be reviewed in conjunction with their hire date. Employees are reviewed after 6 months of hire, their 1 year anniversary and then every 6 months after that.      Your Supervisor will fill out a review form and go over it with you. This form shows you what you are doing well and where you need to improve.   All other employees are reviewed annually on a common date. The review starts with the self-assessment process, which is your own evaluation of your yearly performance. You and your Supervisor should meet to discuss your self-assessment several weeks prior to receiving your final evaluation. This provides your Supervisor with valuable input needed to evaluate your overall performance. As these processes occur during the year, you will receive specific information to assist you in more thoroughly understanding HGS’ compensation program.   If You Decide to Leave Your Job We hope you’ll be here for a long time. But if you do decide to leave, please tell your leader at least two weeks before your last day. This gives us time to find someone to replace you. Human Resources schedules exit interviews with all employees voluntarily leaving HGS. We hope to learn from your experience with HGS and take the opportunity to make HGS a better place to work going forward. Remember that you’ll need to return your security badge and any company equipment or files to your supervisor on your last day of work.   Following your departure, HGS’ insurance administrator will send you information via mail. They will let you know how to continue certain health benefits. Any remaining PTO you have will be paid out to you with your final paycheck. In addition, your insurance coverage will terminate on the last day of the month in which your termination is effective and all premium amounts for that last month will be deducted from your final paycheck. If you have 401k assets, contact the 401k administrator or H.R. with any questions about your account.     YOUR BENEFITS PTO Benefit We know that your life is full of other things outside of your job. We want to provide a policy that has the flexibility to meet the complexity of your personal life. Having a bank of paid time off allows you to use the time in a way that suits your individual circumstances.   All part-time and full-time regular employees earn time based on the number of hours they work during the year. Just like you get paid for the hours you work every pay period, you also get a deposit of paid time off in your PTO bank. Report PTO used each pay period to Payroll.   Hourly Employees PTO is provided to assist you with income when you are unable to work. Sometimes those absences are planned vacations and other times they may be last minute emergencies or illnesses. Regardless of the reason, PTO is used to supplement the hours worked on your paycheck and provide you with more consistent income.  You might need to take a day off to: ·         Recover from personal illness ·         Provide care and attention to family members ·         Attend to personal appointments ·         Use as a floating holiday to cover a day an account is closed ·         Take a family vacation ·         Or just enjoy a day of peace and quiet We want to provide a policy that has the flexibility to meet the complexity of your personal life.  Having a bank of paid time off allows you to use the time in a way that suits your own individual circumstances.

Scheduled time off without using PTO will be allowed at the discretion of the department head as business requirements permit.  If an account is closed on a day that is not an HGS-recognized holiday, you may choose to use PTO to receive pay for that day.  For business-impacting events, such as weather closures, earn time usage will be at the discretion of the VP of Operations and the VP of Human Resources.  PTO can only be used for a day off.   Salaried Employees PTO is provided so that you may take vacation or a day off for personal reasons. PTO should be used for full days that you schedule off. You do not need to use PTO for absences less than a full day or for sick days for yourself or your family.   In a one-year period working full-time, you can earn 13 days off.

Should you terminate prior to earning the amount of vacation you have taken, then you will be responsible for paying this advance back to HGS.   Vacation requests can be made by sending an email to your manager specifying the days you would like to take off and including your assigned employee number.  Your paycheck will show the amount of hours you have used year to date.   Time off is important for your physical and mental well-being. To encourage you to take this time each fiscal year, we do not allow you to cash in or carry time over from year to year. You must use your time each year. Any unused PTO at fiscal year’s end March 31 will be forfeited.   Holiday Pay The company recognizes the following six holidays each year: New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day. Since we are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, this does not mean that we are closed on holidays. You may need to work the holidays, but in appreciation we will pay hourly employees a premium.    Holiday Bonus Pay All hourly full-time regular employees will receive eight hours of holiday pay/PTO for each Company holiday. Holiday pay is based on your regular base pay and does not include any premiums.    Total paid hours during the pay period Monday – Sunday of the holiday cannot exceed your regularly scheduled hours. You receive holiday pay hours up to the amount of your regularly scheduled hours, and any remaining holiday pay hours up to 8 will be placed in your PTO bank. For employees on flexible schedules, you can use holiday pay to flex up to the maximum of your pool—any additional holiday pay hours will go into your PTO bank.   Pay on the Holiday All hourly employees who are required to work on the holiday will receive 1 1⁄2 times your hourly rate base pay plus any applicable premiums for all hours worked on the holiday.   All full-time employees who work on the holiday will receive an additional 8 hours of PTO in their bank to be used during future pay periods.   To make the benefits of holiday pay fair for all employees you need to: • Work all scheduled hours on the day scheduled prior to and following the holiday, • Work all hours scheduled on the holiday, • Be an hourly full-time regular employee working 30 or more hours weekly, and • Not be on a disciplinary suspension or leave.   A client may have a holiday on a normal HGS business day.  If the client is closed and no work is available, you will have the day off.  You can use your PTO to receive pay for this day not to exceed your normally scheduled hours or maximum of your pool. If a salaried employee and the holiday falls on your day off or you are required to work, you may take another day off the week before or after the holiday.   Health Insurance Medical coverage is an undeniable necessity today given escalating health care costs. Without coverage, a single hospital visit could set you back financially for years. HGS’ medical benefits help you pay for you and your family’s medical expenses when you are sick, injured or faced with a catastrophic medical situation. We are also committed to ensuring that you and your family stay healthy.   Most HGS locations utilize a Preferred Provider Option PPO. This means a list of preferred doctors and hospitals has been established with discounted rates. This helps HGS keep medical costs and your premiums down. We call doctors and hospitals on this list participating or “in-network.” If a doctor or hospital is not on this list, we call them non-participating or “out-of-network”. To receive the highest level of benefit you need to seek treatment from physicians and hospitals in the Preferred Provider network.   Who is covered and when?

Flexible Spending Accounts HGS offers you Health Care Flexible Spending Accounts and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts if you are regularly scheduled to work 30+ hours per week. Before the start of every year, you choose an annual amount for each account.  This amount is then automatically deducted in equal amounts from each paycheck. The deduction is taken before Social Security, federal and most state income taxes are determined.   This money is then placed into the separate accounts to reimburse you tax-free for health care or dependent care expenses incurred during the year. Typical health care expenses include physician visit or prescription drug co-pays, annual deductible amounts, eye glasses/contact lenses and more. Your Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account can help you with the expenses of caring for dependent children or parents. Estimate very carefully what to put in the account, because any money you do not use cannot be refunded to you.   Life and AD&D Insurance It’s reassuring to know that if you die, your family members will receive financial protection.   If you are regularly scheduled to work 30+ hours per week, HGS provides you life and accidental death and dismemberment AD&D insurance at no cost. This coverage is equal to your annual base pay, until you reach the age of 65+, when the payable benefit is reduced to 65% of your annual base pay.   You can also purchase additional coverage for yourself, your spouse, or your children. Full-time Regular Support Staff employees of HGS are eligible for benefits on the 91st day of employment.

Disability Income Becoming disabled can be difficult to accept both emotionally and financially. Whether your disability results from illness or injury, pregnancy or childbirth, it prevents you from performing your normal work function, and that can be financially stressful.   Full-time Regular Support Staff employees of HGS are eligible for benefits on the 91st day of employment.  Full-time Regular Administrative Staff and Executive employees of HGS are eligible for benefits on the date of hire.  Employees must be working 30 hours or more per week to be considered eligible. See the Benefit Enrollment Guide for complete details.   If you are unable to perform your responsibilities due to a disability certified by a physician for more than 14 days, HGS offers disability benefits so your financial concerns over loss of pay can be relieved. Hourly employees need to use their available PTO if they would like to receive pay for the first 14 days; otherwise the time is unpaid. If you are a salaried employee, the waiting period is paid, since your PTO does not include sick days. After the waiting period, HGS’ disability policy pays 60% of your base salary up to the stated plan maximum.   401k Retirement Savings Plan The HGS 401k plan is an excellent way for you to build income for your retirement years. Through the plan you can set aside a portion of your pay before taxes!  For every dollar you save – up to 4 percent of your pay – HGS adds 50 cents to your investment!  You can invest in a menu of different funds, each with a different level of estimated risk and return.   You do not pay taxes now on the money you put into the plan. You pay the taxes later when you take it out, for instance upon retirement or other withdrawals. Additionally, your 401k contribution is not included as taxable income, which may mean you may pay a lower tax percentage. Because you pay less taxes, you have more money to save, contribute to the 401k, or spend as you wish.   Check with Human Resources on plan eligibility and vesting schedules.  Even though the purpose of the 401k plan is to save for retirement, we realize you might need to access those savings for other important financial commitments, like buying a house or sending a child to college. HGS allows you to borrow money from your 401k account. You pay yourself back the money you borrowed plus interest, and you can keep contributing to your account.       Section VI LEAVES OF ABSENCE   Family/Medical Leave HGS provides Family/Medical leave to help you balance personal demands for your time with your commitment to HGS. Approved leaves of absence do not count as unscheduled/personal hours under the Attendance Guidelines. These questions and answers highlight information about HGS’ Family/Medical leave. For more information, contact your H.R. Representative.   Who is eligible for a Family/Medical Leave of Absence? You are eligible for a Family/Medical leave of absence when you have worked for HGS at least one year and have worked at least 1250 hours in the 12 months prior to your request. Leaves of absence may be taken for: The birth and care of your newborn child Placement of a child with you for adoption or foster care Your own Serious Health Condition that makes you unable to perform your job To care for your spouse, parent or child, who has a Serious Health Condition   Serious health conditions do not typically include flu, colds, headaches, etc. Instead serious health conditions include pregnancy, illnesses which require hospitalization or long-term or chronic illness such as cancer or diabetes. This includes the need to take an intermittent leave to care for yourself or a family member. Worker’s compensation and Family/Medical leave of absence may be counted concurrently for a serious health condition.   Military FMLA Leave If you have a spouse, son, daughter, or parent on active duty or is called to active duty in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation, then you may also use your 12 weeks of unpaid leave entitlement to address certain qualifying exigencies such as attending specific military events, arranging alternate childcare, financial and legal arrangements, to attend certain counseling sessions and attend post-deployment reintegration briefings.   Special FMLA Leave You may also be entitled to take up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave in a single 12 month period if the leave is for the care of your spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin who is a current service member with a serious injury or illness.   What if I don’t qualify for a Family/Medical leave of absence? HGS’ leave of absence policy is patterned after the Family & Medical Leave Act FMLA of 1993. If you do not meet the FMLA requirements you may still apply for a leave of absence. Depending on business circumstances and individual performance, an employee who does not qualify for FMLA may be approved for leave.   How do I apply for a leave of absence? 1. Fill out the Application for Leave form – wherever possible apply 30 days in advance of your leave start date. If you are already out, please contact your supervisor and Human Resources to notify HGS of your need for a leave. Human Resources will contact you with approval for your leave or requests for additional information once we have received your application.   2. Submit any requested medical documentation for your leave and/or insurance forms to apply for disability benefits if you have short-term disability insurance.   How long can I be on a leave of absence? The maximum Family/Medical leave is 12 weeks within a rolling 12-month period rolling 12-month period measured backwards from the date you first use leave. If you’re approved for benefits, your short-term/long-term disability benefits will run concurrent with Family/Medical leave and may extend beyond the 12 weeks allowed under FMLA. You may not take more than 26 weeks of leave in a 12-month period.   Will I be paid while on leave? If you have disability insurance, you may be eligible for short-term disability benefits. Short-term disability benefits are 60% of your base salary up to the stated plan maximum. Short-term disability benefits are payable after a 14-day waiting period and approval of the short-term disability application. During the waiting period, hourly employees may choose to use available PTO to receive compensation.  If you are a salaried employee, this waiting period is paid, since your PTO does not include sick days.   Can I keep my insurance while on leave? You can continue your insurance coverage during your leave as long as you continue to pay your premiums. Payment must be arranged through Human Resources.   What happens when I am ready to come back to work? Stay in contact with your supervisor and Human Resources while on leave. We need to know when to expect you back. If you are on a leave because of your own serious health condition, you must return to work with a medical release from your doctor. Without the release, we cannot allow you to work.   If you return from an approved Family/Medical leave of absence within 12 weeks, HGS will place you back in your previous job or an equivalent job with the same pay, benefits and conditions of employment. Otherwise, HGS will try to find an equivalent position for you in the company or another open position that best matches your skills and abilities.   For more information about your rights and responsibilities under FMLA, please see section VIII.   Military Leave Military leave will be granted in accordance with applicable laws. To request a military leave, fill out an application for leave and submit this request to Human Resources. Please let us know of your need for leave in advance whenever possible. If you’re a member of the military with monthly duty, you only need to submit one request so long as your military duty schedule remains unchanged.   Upon return from military leave other than regular monthly duty, please provide documentation of the leave, i.e. military orders showing the date of release from duty and a certificate showing satisfactory performance of duty. You must make a timely reapplication for employment and have been discharged with satisfactory service to be eligible for reinstatement. We will promptly reinstate you to your former position with full seniority, or a position offering the same pay, rank and seniority. Your anniversary date or review time will not be adjusted.   Funeral Leave HGS also pays for time off should a member of your immediate family pass away.  The term “immediate family” includes your son, daughter, stepchildren, spouse, mother, father, brother, sister, great grandparents, grandchildren, stepparents, stepsiblings and the in-laws for these relations. If you are a Regular Full time or Part time employee you may be eligible for a maximum of two weeks funeral leave with pay for the death of your son, daughter, stepchildren or spouse.  Funeral leave for all other immediate family members is a maximum of three consecutive calendar days.  You will not be paid for any day you aren’t scheduled to work and documentation must be submitted upon your return.   Jury Duty Leave If you are summoned for jury duty, HGS wants you to fulfill that responsibility of good citizenship. Let your supervisor know that you have been summoned as soon as possible. HGS will pay you for your scheduled work hours that day. Please partner with your supervisor to better understand how jury duty may impact your specific work schedule. You need to reimburse the company for the amount of pay you might receive for jury duty this does not include mileage or parking, if applicable.   The same benefits and procedures will apply if you are subpoenaed to testify as a witness in a proceeding to which you are not a party of interest.   Section VII   ADDITIONAL WORK RESPONSIBILITIES   Confidential Information Some things you hear at HGS are confidential, like sensitive information about the company’s business, our clients, or one of your co-workers. That information is private and confidential - including things like co-workers phone numbers, addresses, and pay-rate information as well as whom our clients are. So don’t share it with anyone unless your manager asks you to. Just as you don’t want other co-workers sharing your personal or private information, you should not talk or gossip about other co-workers.   Don’t share your computer password with others or use someone else’s password. And keep in mind that our computers store valuable, confidential information. This information should not be used for personal gain or shared with unauthorized parties.   Computer Usage Employees who have access to the company’s e-mail and computer systems need to be aware of the responsibilities that accompany such access. For example, unauthorized use, reproduction or removing any information sources and/or company equipment, as well as installing or copying unauthorized software, are expressly prohibited.   Do not install any of your own software on HGS computers. Games and other personal programs use up time and space we count on for business use.

Do not copy software from HGS computers and install it at home or on any other computer. Misuse of computer systems, information or software could lead to termination and/or prosecution.   E-mail should be used for business communication. Examples of inappropriate e-mail include sending or forwarding jokes, software attachments, games, chain letters, gossip, offensive or disruptive messages. Messages you send over the e-mail system are not private and may be reviewed by the company at any point. Non-business usage slows the efficiency and effectiveness of the communication tool. Inappropriate usage of the system will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.   Internet Usage Access to the Internet has been provided for the benefit of the company and our customers. Employees who have access to the Internet are responsible for using the Internet productively.   You should only access the Internet when it is required by your job or with express permission from your supervisor. Misuse of your computer or the Internet will lead to corrective action, up to and including termination.   Customer Payment Card Information Some HGS client programs involve taking orders from customers via credit card, or accessing customers’ accounts which store payment card information.  Misuse of payment card information will lead to corrective action, up to and including termination. Do not write down on paper other than program required downtime form any customer credit card numbers or CVV2 security code information. If downtime forms require credit card information, follow the documented steps to give that form to the designated resource and no one else. Do not email credit card information.  Delete any credit card information from an email before it is sent back the customer or forwarded to a supervisor or other HGS employee.   Social Media   HGS recognizes the importance of social media for its employees and therefore has developed the following Social Media guideline to ensure that all employees who participate in any form of social networking understand and comply with appropriate on-line conduct whether authorized to do so using HGS Technology Resources or engaging in social media use away from the office.   Social Media Guidelines Do not use the HGS logo or trademark without written consent Do not link to HGS’ websites, Web logs or post company material. Do not disclose confidential company business, its products and/or services. Do not mention HGS employees, clients, or customers without their express consent. Do not post obscenities, defamatory, threatening, harassing, embarrassing or discriminatory comments about HGS employees, clients or customers. Use your name, instead of your screen name and only post your personal views and your views alone and do not represent the views of the company. Demonstrate respect for the dignity of the company, its owners, clients and employees. Be aware that you are legally accountable for anything you write or present on social media.  You may also be personally sued by HGS employees, clients, customers, affiliates, or other individuals, if your comments are viewed as defamatory, harassing or create a hostile work environment.  HGS monitors the use of its name, trademarks, etc. and employee use of technology resources and the Internet, including use of social media and social networking sites. Ensure you comply with copyright laws, and cite or reference sources appropriately.   It is important that all employees are aware of the implication of engaging in forms of social networking.  If you are uncertain about the appropriateness of social media posting, consult with your supervisor, management staff or Human Resources Department.  Employees need to use good judgment when engaging in social media regardless of whether online comments are related to their job. Any employee violating these guidelines will be subject to corrective action up to and including termination of employment.    Solicitation/Distribution Policies HGS wants to make sure all employees can work free of the distraction and uncomfortable pressure that can be created by solicitation and distribution. That’s why HGS maintains a “No Solicitation/No Distribution” policy for all employees.   The policy is simple: You may not “solicit” co-workers during work time in work areas. “Soliciting” includes things like asking co-workers to join organizations or pools, buy memberships or subscriptions, or make pledges or gifts to charities, other than company-sponsored charities and events. The “No Distribution” part of the policy prohibits employees from distributing literature at all times in work areas.   Selling merchandise or conducting monetary transactions are always off limits if they are: • For personal profit • For commercial purposes • For a charitable program which has not received prior approval by Human Resources.*   *Exception to No Solicitation/Distribution – HGS does not restrict employees’ involvement in company-sponsored activities connected with charitable giving campaigns.    Corrective Action We can’t list all of HGS’ performance expectations here. We have listed a few examples of the most serious misconduct, which can lead to immediate discharge:   1. Falsifying company documents or documents relied upon by the company - for example, time records, applications/resumes, leave forms, doctor’s notes, or reimbursement forms.   2. Using or possessing alcohol, drugs, weapons or explosives on company property.   3. Fighting or threatening behavior.   4. Violating HGS’ harassment policy.   5. Releasing or dodging telephone calls.   6. Stealing, regardless of the amount.   7. Reckless conduct, such as creating substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm, damage, or injury to another person or company property.   8. Detrimental behavior, such as behavior which substantially impairs the employee’s ability to function effectively as an HGS employee because of the effect on the employee’s relationship with other employees or on the business.   9. Negligent conduct, such as failing to use ordinary and reasonable care in the performance of your work whether or not on company premises.   10. Insubordination.   11. Accessing offensive or inappropriate Internet sites.   This list is not exhaustive, but gives you an idea of the types of unacceptable behavior that may result in termination.   If your performance is not up to HGS standards you can be terminated at any time without prior notice of dismissal.     Other Employment and Conflicts of Interest If you have another job and it interferes with your performance, scheduling demands, or the ability to meet the requirements of HGS, you may be asked to adjust or terminate your other job if you want to remain employed with HGS. Outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited. You may not receive any income or material gain from individuals outside HGS for materials produced or services rendered while performing your job for HGS.     Harassment Policy At HGS, harassment is not allowed. Not by anyone. That includes supervisors, managers, co-workers, customers and vendors.   What is harassment? Harassment can be teasing, jokes or other remarks about someone’s race, color, sex, national origin, gender, citizenship, status, religion, age or disability.  Harassment can be pictures or objects that make you uncomfortable. Harassment can be unwanted touching.   Harassment can also be conduct that affects your work or makes your work environment intimidating, hostile or offensive. Harassment includes using derogatory “slang” names to refer to members of an entire group or race, or imitating or making fun of the physical or mental limits due to an employee’s disability.   What is sexual harassment? Sexual harassment can be: • Making sexual advances, asking for sexual favors, or making sexually suggestive comments. • Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors. • Making sexual jokes or comments. • Using graphic or sexually degrading language to describe someone. • Using foul or obscene gestures. • Passing around or displaying on your computer sexually suggestive or obscene material, pictures, or objects. • Making unwanted physical contact, like patting, pinching or grabbing. • Threatening or suggesting that part of your job - like work assignments, promotions, reviews or wages - will suffer if you object to a person’s advances or behavior.   Steps for Reporting Harassment HGS needs your help to stop harassment. So if you think you’ve been harassed, you need to let somebody know right away. Here are steps you should take: • If you feel comfortable, talk to the person who is bothering you; ask them to stop. • If you aren’t comfortable talking to that person, or if talking doesn’t work, then explain your concerns to any of the following people: * Your supervisor * The manager in charge of your location * Your Human Resources Representative • If you think you are being harassed and you’re uncomfortable talking about it, you can use the “Connect Us” card instead. Be sure to clearly explain the situation and include your name and location, so HGS can follow up with an investigation. A necessary part of the investigation will normally include interviews to discuss the allegations to determine their truthfulness and to determine whether behavior in need of correction has occurred.   Quick Response to Harassment HGS investigates all harassment complaints as quickly and completely as possible. HGS is serious about stopping harassment. So if an investigation shows that you’ve been harassed, HGS will take prompt and appropriate corrective action up to and including termination of the harassing person’s job with HGS.   No Retaliation No one is allowed to retaliate against anyone who has reported harassment or helped investigate a harassment complaint. If you feel that someone has retaliated against you because of a complaint, follow the “Steps for Reporting Harassment”. People who retaliate or interfere with an investigation will face corrective action up to and including the loss of their jobs with HGS.   Tell the Truth HGS fully intends to protect its employees from harassment. On the other hand, if an employee makes a false harassment claim or a co-worker provides false information about a claim, he/she will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.       Drug-Free Workplace HGS is committed to providing a drug-free workplace. Employees will not distribute, possess or use any type of controlled substance or alcohol on company premises. Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including loss of your job with HGS.   Drug/Alcohol Testing Program HGS will assist in the prevention, identification, and resolution of drug and/or alcohol related problems. As part of our effort to ensure an environment free from drug and alcohol abuse, upon reasonable cause, any employee may be required to submit to drug/alcohol screening. Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.   A positive test will result in the employee being referred for a professional assessment and rehabilitation if necessary and/or being disciplined up to and including termination depending on the particular facts and circumstances involved. Failure of an employee to participate in the assessment and a recognized drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation program at the request of HGS shall be considered inappropriate conduct of a serious nature and will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. A negative result will not preclude HGS from taking disciplinary action if circumstances warrant.
