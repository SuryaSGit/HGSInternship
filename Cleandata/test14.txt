Dealer No Response Click "Read More" to Access Article   Dealer No Response “They haven’t reached out” “I haven’t heard from them” “Still waiting on a phone call”   Required Words None! Predefined Content: I'm sorry to hear nobody reached out to you. I'd be happy to resend your information. If you'd like to reach out immediately, you can call the dealer at PHONENUMBER.   Things to Keep in Mind: Check our previous conversation to see if the dealer has had plenty of time to reach out. If the dealer hasn’t reached out after six 6 business hours, we can use this response. You will need to take into consideration the dealer hours to calculate if this time has passed If the dealer has not had enough time to reach out, we should tell this to the customer and reassure them somebody will be reaching out Ex, “It looks like the dealership has not been open or had an opportunity to follow up with you since our last conversation. They will be back open on Monday at 8am and will reach out as soon as they are available” If urgency is expressed, we can provide the dealer number If the customer says the dealer reached out, but we do not have a previous conversation, we will simply say we will tell the dealer they'd like to be contacted ​"I'll let the dealer know you'd like to hear from them about this VEHICLE" Still send #ContactInfoText
