If any reports of Cat B, Category B cannot legally return to road - Irreparable damage. May have salvageable parts. Vehicles in categories S and N can be repaired and resold, but have been deemed uneconomical to repair by an insurer If such a car is advertised on our site you'll see the red 'History Alert' symbol. Category N - Non-structural damage, repaired and safely returned to the road. Category S - Structural damage, repaired and safely returned to the road. If clear, “no issues reported”
